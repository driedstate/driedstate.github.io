    <p class="LongText">This is not zombo.com, but a (BETTER!!!) remake of it. If you ever thought this was the REAL zombo.com then you have been deceived heavily and must now come to terms with that realization. You can push that feeling away, knowing you have been in the wrong, but deep down you will always know that you have been tricked by someone who made a zombo clone. Check out Zombo.com now! For the cheap price of nothing (except the price you pay for energy and internet) you can check out all zombo.com has to offer today! If you want to stay here though you are happily welcome! You may even take a seat to wonder about how this magnificient site was made! Here is the answer: I have no idea! I just thought it would be easy to remake this website so I did! That's all! David helped me to figure out how I put a gif on a website, so shout out to him! He is way more talented than me! Check out his website too! Anyways, how have you been lately? How does it feel reading this text, knowing you could do literally anything else in the world. You don't have to read this, yet you still sit there and look at this text! Wonderful. I'm just wasting your time, but that doesn't seem to bother you. Stop. Seriously. This is not even the real zombo.com man. Why are you reading this? Have you not caught on by now that this is a waste of time? Have you atleast by now checked out the original zombo.com? I'm waiting if you haven't! Really, you should check the website out! I'm not trying to trick you to go on some bad website, I just like the simplicity of zombo.com! My favourite site! Always there if you need help! Active support around the clock! I really don't want to work on this website some more so I'm just writing this right now out of boredom. I really need to get better at this programming stuff, but that's not what you care about, do you? You only care about ZOMBO.COM!!! I loooooove Zombo.com! Have you ever felt like you can't look away from the screen? That's what I feel about zombo.com! Hey I wrote zombo.com 11 times so far! You can check and count each time I wrote that so far! Please do, because I didn't count actually! I just wrote a number down that feels right and reminds me of zombo.com! I love zombo.com, you love zombo.com, we all love zombo.com! I really hope you are still reading so this wasn't a waste of time for ME! See it'sa double edged sword! Either I waste your time, or I waste my own! Interesting! That shortly distracted me from how much I love zombo.com! How strange it is to be anything at all. EXCEPT zombo.com! Being zombo.com must be awesome! Are you perchance Mr.Zombo himself? Mr.Zombo in the flesh? No... It can't be. Mr.Zombo isn't a human. It is a concept, a god, an idea. How dare I also assume that zombo.com is male? A true zombo.com enjoyer like ME knows that zombo.com is androgynous! Or are they? Probably? Wait let me google the gender of a website real quick! While you wait, here are some interesting facts about Whales! Whales are the largest animals on Earth, with blue whales reaching up to 98 feet long; they are mammals and breathe air, but sleep with half their brain awake at a time; some, like sperm whales, have massive brains, with the largest brain of any animal ever recorded! Anyways, I'm back, I'm back! Here with website genders! Well, bad news. No concrete proof of websites having any sort of gender! That's really interesting. To be or not to be they said. I will stick with my conspiracy of zombo.com being a god though. Oh my god I finally said Zombo.com again! That's amazing, it's been a long time! Good news zombo.com clone lovers! David wants to help me add the sound effect this clone website is missing! Maybe one day I can be better than the original zombo.com. I made it mom, I'm better than zombo.com! Yay that's so awesome! I'm so proud of zombo.com for teaching me the way of the zombos. I, you, WE are the zombos. If you read until this very sentence without skipping past any important details, you have done it! You are officially one of the zombos man! You can be proud of yourself man! Have you ever felt this feeling of existential dread? This feeling like you don't belong? Well I have felt that for a long time, but then I met zombo.com! This is the story of how I met your zombo! I have always thought very fond of funny names like zombo.com and to be honest, they have a great sense of humour! Zombo knows how to make me laugh! Zombo may not look much to you, but I see Zombo.com through different eyes and to me Zombo looks like a million bucks! Can I get a witness in here? Somebody? No? Darn it nobody here except me and Zombo. That's sad. Oh well, more zombo.com for me. The reader who read the first few sentences already stopped or skipped through the text. Well I'm still gonna waste your time though, Imaginary reader! You have no idea how happy I am I can share zombo.com and their infinite knowledge to you! If only I could make you two real. You two would be like lemon- and apricot icecream! You, imaginary reader! Yes you! Just don't let yourself fall to the curse of the zombo.evil that I just made up or you will fall into a world of infinite despair and destruction! What a sad ending to this amazing tale zombo.com has brought us on would that be? I can't imagine that! I can, I lied, but I don't want to imagine that, do you feel me? That's blasphemy to not believe in zombo.com! You will end up with zombo.evil for eternal damnnation! You have to obey the right zombo or else you will end up in zombo.evil's evil castle for eternal damnnation in another zombo's belief's! The zombo was promised to them zombo.com years ago! Anyways let me stop with the zombo stuff and let me talk about important stuff. How do YOU eat your cereal? Milk fírst or cereal first. Please tell me! Quick! I don't havwe much time. Okay I lied, I don't eat cereal. Milk gives me a stomach ache. Unlike zombo.com who is the reason why I have butterflies! I'm not kidding! I caught one yesterday! His name is Imaginary reader! I forgot his colours but they were veeeery zombo.com like. My favourite colours are the ones from the website! I would never disappoint you zombo.com, you can't imagine the pain I would be in if I hadn't found you. My life would be ruined, but you were there to save it dear zombo.com. To any reader, I wrote this myself, I hate ai, that stuff was a terrible invention. Anyways. ZOMBO, DONT LEAVE ME HERE. Anyways so what is your favourite cookie? I personally looove those chocolate, orange ones my grandma recently bought me. I kept some for zombo.com! I hope I advertised zombo.com enough now. I have different things to worry about... Like my english class! I swear it is so dumb how all I'm saying is like TeChNiCaLlY correct, but also wrong because I haven't used the exact correct wording. Like every american, british person or Kangaroo person can understand me. Who cares if I haven't used the ONE correct word in the dictionary. There are thousands of words to describe stuff. Stuff like zombo.com. No. Zombo.com isn't just "stuff" to me. It is way more important than that. But  you wouldn't know that, would you? You are just someone looking from the outside in. You aren't a part of it, you are merely a spectator of what's happening. Would you believe me if I told you that zombo.com is an old website? Yea man, it's crazy revolutionary! It feels like the second coming of Jesus motherloving Christ. I don't even care what the teacher is saying anymore. It's just me and zombo.com forever, riding into the sunset. It's like Nutella and butter (DELICIOUS!!!) and there's no stopping. By the way: Did you know that Einsteins last words are unknown? That is so crazy, like a genius just dying without knowing his last wish or words. Have you ever considered fading away with nobody there to lend a hand or atleast listen to your final wish? I have, but! ZOMBO.COM STOPPED THAT, HELL YEA! By the way! Have you realized I wasn't able to spell "have" correct earlier and added an extra w? No? I thought so, you don't notice the little errors in life, do you? How strange it is to be anything at all... Hey, I said that before in this text, haven't I? Go look for yourself fool. I may have tricked you. But don't worry too much about it. That just gives you brainworms. Hey what is your favourite musician? I am quite a fan of Rob Zombo. Very inspiring. When will you stop reading man... Please I got other stuff to doooo I swear! Hey man listen here! If you don't stop reading RIGHT now you won't get a piece of my grandmas chocolate! Ha! You really fell for that, didn't you! You fool! Absolute buffoon! You skellywag! You smooth criminal (by Michael Zombo) ! You will NEVER get any chocolate! Zombo ate it all :3 Well. That's sad. I'm sorry for lying to you... Hey there. I really enjoyed writing this, but now it's getting boring. Seriously this time. No more pretending I love this zombo website. No more lies. Okay, well. This is it. If you skipped to the end screw you! This was poetry of it's highest level (except that it isn't anything like poetry) and if you don't get it you simply aren't smart enough to get it! Well. Goodbye Zombo.com. You were a great friend. But now it is time to say goodbye once and for all... Goodbye zombo.com clone. Farewell...maybe forever </p>
